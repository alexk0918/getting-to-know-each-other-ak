        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hey, I'm Alex! I'm 21 years old, but I'm turning 22 on the 18th of September. I'm majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Data Science and a concentration on Games and Simulation Programming. I'm starting my fourth year at Lewis, and I couldn't be more excited, since this level and scale of class is what I have been looking forward to for a while now. I've made it this far with the support of my family, which consists of my mom, Denise, my dad, George, and my brother, Nick. And, I probably would be much less happy without my dog, Winston, who is a 5 year old golden retriever! My brother is married to a very nice woman, Mary, and they have two beautiful daughters named Harper and Kinsley, who are 2 years old and almost 2 months old respectively. I'm very proud to be an uncle to those two!</p>

        <h2>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Better software development ethics through the use of SDLCs </li>
            <li>Use cloud computing effectively in a personal project</li>
            <li>Linking back-end and front-end code most effectively</li>
            <li>Managing code in a team</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My Favorite Hobby / Activity</h2>
        <p>I really enjoy doing a number of things. This can range from playing video games to trying to produce music, with an emphasis on the try part. As mentioned, I enjoy playing video games, with my current favorite being Skyrim. It's an outdated game but with a mod list of over 800, it becomes a much more modern game. I like video editing from time to time, but I've been on a break as of late. On top of listening to music, I am currently learning how to produce music. My favorite artist of all time is a punk band called Neck Deep, with my favorite song being "19 Seventy Sumthin'". I don't want to produce music like theirs, though. I am looking to make music similar to Kevin Penkin's piece titled "OLD STORIES". That piece is from one of my favorite animes called Made in Abyss, which watching anime is another one of my hobbies.</p>

        <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
        <p>One fun fact about me is that I've worked at a dog specialty store called Joy's Best Bites for just about 2 years now! We're partially a regular pet store but we're also pretty unique because we have our own bakery where we make dog cookies, cupcakes, pizzas, and even birthday cakes! In that video of Winston, he's eating one of the cookies we make there!</p>
