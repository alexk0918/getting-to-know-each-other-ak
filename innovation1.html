            This is the turing machine. Turing machines are a fundamental concept in computer science, first created by a British mathematician, Alan Turing, in the 1930s. The turing machine is a theoretical model of computation and consists of a tape with an infinite length and a read/write head that can move left or right along the tape. Turing machines can perform various tasks, and they played a pivotal role in understanding the limits of what can be computed algorithmically. Alan Turing's work on these machines laid the foundation for the theory of computation, and it was key in proving the existence of problems that are undecidable, thus influencing the development of modern computing and the field of theoretical computer science.
